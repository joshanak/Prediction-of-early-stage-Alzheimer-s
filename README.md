# Prediction-of-early-stage-Alzheimer-s
Chosen project for my university subject - Introduction to Data science


The task replicates the already written research article "Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Models" (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.853294/full) as a form of exercise to get introduced to the field of Data Science.

The project follows three steps - Data handling, analysis and visualization; replicating the articles result, improving the results
